#### Pre-made installation

> **NOTE:** you no longer have to do run build it since its already made. but because node_modules is empty. you can do npm i or install.

```bash

npm install

# Start serving
npm run serve
```
and enjoj!

but if you're too damn lazy to npm i on this.
download the zip file so you dont have to.
